need to recreate current agent.py file
and make that in fastapi so that the agents written in C or C# or powershell 
are simpler and make simple post requests to fastapi, fastapi will handle all the changing of data in the database
and the agents will just get responses with the current state of the document
fast api should also handle initial authentication then hand out JWT tokens for subsiquent requests
